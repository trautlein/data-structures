#data-structures
This is a project I completed as a student at [hackreactor](http://hackreactor.com). This project was worked on with @f-fong. The data structures we implemented in JavaScript are linked lists, hash tables (not just creating an object), graphs, stacks, queues, trees, binary search trees, and sets.
